# MadmapperMaterial-ABMixer

Material for MadMapper which acts as a classic AB mixer

Based on "Cross Zoom Transition" 2D FX from public Library, I've found it more suited to my usage as a material
Nothing changed on the automation and audio reactive part, it's the same as original 2D FX

Added some others transitions, mostly for test purposes

Repositery will not be updated.
Use it as a base for your own needs

# Usage

Create 2 output routed to internal loopback acting as your A & B channels
Used them in material as your A & B sources
